    <h1>Hello! I am Irakoze Yves</h1>
    
    <p>I am a student at TTCS, located in Cyahinda, South Province, Rwanda. I am currently studying in my senior five year, and I am preparing to complete my sixth year of college education. During my studies, I have been focusing on several important subjects, including Psychology, Foundation of Education, Teaching Methods, and Teaching Practices. These courses have helped me understand how people learn, how to plan effective lessons, and how to communicate knowledge clearly to others.</p>
    
    <p>I have a strong interest in Biology and Chemistry because they allow me to explore the natural world and understand how life works. Chemistry shows us how substances interact and create new things, while Biology explains the processes of life and helps us understand ourselves and the living world more deeply. My studies in science, combined with education courses, help me think critically and develop skills to share knowledge with others effectively.</p>
    
    <p>My goal is to continue learning, improving my mind, and applying my knowledge to create innovative solutions for the future. I am particularly interested in technology and artificial intelligence, and I dream of building tools and systems that can help people learn and solve problems. I believe that by combining my education, creativity, and dedication, I can contribute positively to my community and beyond.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring new ideas, playing video games, and watching movies. These activities help me relax and also inspire creativity in my thinking. I believe that a curious and open mind, combined with discipline and hard work, is the key to personal growth and success.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, I am committed to developing myself both intellectually and practically. I hope to use my education and skills to make a difference in the world, while continuing to learn and grow every day.</p>
